### WGSL101

WGSL101 is a web application designed to teach the WGSL language, which is used
for writing shaders in WebGPU. Developed as my dissertation project, this
application serves both students and developers.

The platform features a code editor with syntax highlighting, code completion,
and AI-powered explanations for WGSL code. Users can write and execute shaders
in real-time, viewing the results directly in their browser.

Additionally, WGSL101 offers a tutorial section with lessons and exercises to
facilitate learning. Users can take quizzes to test their knowledge, track their
progress, and utilize AI assistance throughout their learning journey.
