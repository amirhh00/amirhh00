### Schilte

[Schilte](https://configurator.schilte.nl) is a web application designed for creating customizable 3D cabinet models. Users can modify the cabinet's dimensions, colors, and materials, as well as add features like shelves, doors, and drawers. The application allows users to view and rotate the cabinet in 3D, save their designs, and share them with others.
Additionally, APIs were developed using Strapi, allowing the owner to manage prices and products through an intuitive dashboard interface.
